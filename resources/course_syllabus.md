# Course Syllabus: Startup Studio - AI-Accelerated Building & Validation

## Course Information
- **Course Title:** Startup Studio: AI-Accelerated Building & Validation
- **Course Number:** TBD
- **Semester:** Spring 2026
- **Credits:** 3
- **Department:** Columbia University - Computer Science

## Instructors
- **Lydia Chilton** - Assistant Professor of Computer Science
- **Ken St. Clair** -  Adjunct Assistant Professor of Computer Science

## Course Summary

Startup Studio is a hands-on course that immerses students in the full cycle of technology entrepreneurship: from concept development to AI-assisted product building to real-world validation. Student teams will form startups, create products using modern AI coding and design tools, and engage real users through demand validation techniques such as paid advertising and UX interviews. Students will learn to develop minimal viable products (MVPs), run growth experiments, and iterate based on real user feedback.

### Key Differentiators
- **Concept testing** through Wizard of Oz testing and vaporware site launches
- **Conducting paid ad campaigns** for demand validation  
- **Building real, working products** leveraging AI for rapid development
- **Interviewing real users** and integrating feedback into design and development
- **Earning industry-recognized certifications** in digital marketing and analytics (Meta Blueprint and Google Analytics), enhancing both practical skills and resumes

By the end of the semester, students will have built and validated a technology product and gained experience in both technical development and entrepreneurial growth methods.

## Intellectual Property & Public Disclosure Policy

### Key Points
- **No Confidentiality:** All work developed in this class is open and may be shared publicly
- **Pre-existing IP:** Students retain rights to intellectual property they bring into the course
- **In-class Developed Work:** Intended for open, collaborative use within the class and for public viewing as part of demand validation efforts
- **Continuation Beyond Class:** If teams wish to pursue their project commercially post-class, they should negotiate ownership and IP rights internally and/or with external advisors
- **Site Shutdown or Continuation:** Teams will decide post-semester whether to shut down their products/sites or continue development independently

> **Note:** This course is not an incubator, and Columbia University does not claim ownership of student-developed IP unless university-owned technologies are involved.

## Budget

Each team will need a modest budget for:

- **Ad Spend (Week 4):** $100/team for demand validation
- **User Incentives (Week 9):** $100/team for participant compensation during user interviews

**Total budget per team:** $200

## Additional Notes

### AI Tools
Students are encouraged to use AI tools such as GitHub Copilot, GPT models, and AI design assistants where appropriate.

### Guest Speakers
Sessions with product designers, UX researchers, and growth marketers may be scheduled to provide real-world perspectives *(tentative)*.

### Certifications
Students will complete the Meta Blueprint and Google Analytics certifications as part of the course, gaining industry-recognized credentials that enhance their resumes and practical skills.

## Demo Day Format 

### Audience
Class peers, instructors, invited alumni, company hiring reps, potential mentors.

### Format
- Each team gets **7 minutes** to present (5 min pitch, 2 min Q&A)
- Pitches should cover: Problem, Solution, Validation results, Iteration history, Future vision
- Judging (if desired) or just feedback panel with industry guests
